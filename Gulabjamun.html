<font size=5><p>Gulab Jamun is a very popular Indian sweet. There are some versions of making it with khoya, milk powder, bread or sweet potatoes.</p>
It is made traditionally with dried milk solids. These dried milk solids are also called as khoya or mawa in Hindi. An easy version is also made with milk powder.
In this recipe post I am sharing both the versions.
<p><b>Gulab Jamun made with Khoya</b>– Traditional method for the best taste and a soft melt in the mouth texture.</p>
<p><b>Gulab Jamun made with Milk Powder</b> – Easy and handy recipe if you don’t have khoya.</p>
Both the recipes are easy and even beginners can make these tried and tested delicious melt in the mouth gulab jamun. You can choose the method depending on the ingredients you have.</font>

<h2>How to Make Gulab Jamun</h2>
<ol>
<font size=5>
<li>Take 100gms khoya or mawa (200 grams) in a bowl. Soft khoya also known as ‘daap ka khoya’ or ‘chikna khoya’ is used. This is a soft khoya, so it mashes and kneads very well.</li>
<li>Mash it very well. There should be no lumps or small bits or pieces in the khoya. You can also grate and then mash the khoya. </li>
<li>Mix in the flour and baking soda and knead into firm dough. You can use a food processor too.</li>
<li>The dough should be firm but pliable and should not feel dry. If it does feel dry, wet your hands and work the dough again.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into marble-sized balls (jamuns) that are smooth and creaseless. The shape can be round or oblong.</li>
<li>Heat ghee in the kadahi till a piece of dough tossed in comes up at once.</li>
<li>Lower heat and fry a cube of bread till light brown (this lowers the temperature of the ghee).</li>
<li>Lift out bread and add as many jamuns as will fit in, without one touching the other.</li>
<li>Keeping the heat low, fry these till a golden brown all over.</li>
<li>Drain the jamuns out of the ghee, and fry the next lot, increasing the heat for a few seconds and then lowering it again before adding the jamuns.</li>
<li>Keep the gulab jamuns aside till the syrup is ready</li>
<li>Mix the sugar and water and place over low heat, stirring till the sugar dissolves. Make sure it does not boil.</li>
<li>Increase the heat once the sugar dissolves, and then bring mixture to a boil.</li>
<li>Add the milk and water mixture and continue boiling over high flame, without stirring.</li>
<li>Skim off any scum that collects on the sides of the pan.</li>
<li>Cook till syrup thickens a bit. A finger dipped in slightly cold syrup should form a coating on it for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Take syrup off stove and cool for a minimum of half an hour. Strain through a fine nylon sieve or muslin cloth.</li>
<li>Add cardamom and bring syrup to a boil again.</li>
<li>Add the fried gulab jamuns to it and put off the heat. Let jamuns soak for at least half an hour before serving.</li>
